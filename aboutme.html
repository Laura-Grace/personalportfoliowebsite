        <h2 class="aboutmehead">About Me</h2>
        <div class="aboutmepara">
            <p>I grew up in Cheshire, before beginning my undergraduate at the University of Buckingham; I graduated with a 2:1 in History and English.
                Around this time, the pandemic began and I decided to continue studying and gained a PGCE in Primary Education with a focus on Special Needs. 
                However, I realised in my first year of work as a teacher that I passionately valued the ability to be creative, problem-solve and grow through development.
                Unfortunately, this meant that teaching was no longer the career for me as it didn't align with these values. 
                I decided to take some time out of work to pursue various passions of mine, and quickly found myself enamoured by graphic design. 
                I took various courses on Adobe and began to grow my skill set as I used this knowledge to aid in a company I founded. 
                My company also needed a website, and this is how I came to discover front-end development. 
                I have pushed myself to work consistently and with dedication; I am now proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitBash and GitHub.
                I am working on growing these skills further and becoming more well-rounded in a variety of programming languages.
